# MIT xPro Project ðŸ’»
This is one of the projects I was working on to get my professional certificate in Full Stack Development by MIT xPro. 
If you are curious about this rigorous program you can learn more about it [here](https://youtu.be/5CiCtj_2Qsg).

## Pacmen factory
This will create any number of pacmen through factory programming, then give the option to bounce them within a defined area by a button click.
Click start again to see how the packmen speed increases. Every time start is clicked the speed will increase without a limit so play around and have fun! This code in this project is mainly pure javascript.

# *Demo*

### *Usage*: 
1. Click add pacman as many times as you wish and watch them being randomly added.
2. Click start.
3. To update the velocity, click start again each time and watch the speed increase.

### *Roadmap*
Next version will animate the pacmen's mouth as they move.
